For T&T, and MNI coordinates, x increases from left to right, y increases from posterior to anterior, and z increases in the inferior to superior direction.

The voxel to world mappings.

These are simply 4x4 affine transformation matrices represented in the
NIFTI headers (see http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1 ).
These are normally modified by the `realignment' and `coregistration'
modules.  What these matrixes represent is a mapping from
the voxel coordinates (x0,y0,z0) (where the first voxel is at coordinate
(1,1,1)), to coordinates in millimeters (x1,y1,z1).
 
x1 = M(1,1)*x0 + M(1,2)*y0 + M(1,3)*z0 + M(1,4)
y1 = M(2,1)*x0 + M(2,2)*y0 + M(2,3)*z0 + M(2,4)
z1 = M(3,1)*x0 + M(3,2)*y0 + M(3,3)*z0 + M(3,4)

Assuming that image1 has a transformation matrix M1, and image2 has a
transformation matrix M2, the mapping from image1 to image2 is: M2\M1
(ie. from the coordinate system of image1 into millimeters, followed
by a mapping from millimeters into the space of image2).

These matrices allow several realignment or coregistration steps to be
combined into a single operation (without the necessity of resampling the
images several times).  The `.mat' files are also used by the spatial
normalisation module.
